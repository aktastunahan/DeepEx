# QExplore: A Tool for Automatic Exploration of Dynamic Web Applications By Using Reinforcement Learning
QExplore is a dynamic automatic exploration tool for dynamic web applications. It reverse engineers a state-flow model that can be used to automate several web analysis and testing techniques. The tool uses a popular reinforcement learning technique, called Q-learning, to systematically explore a web application. To feed the input fields and explore the states behind the web forms, QExplore uses mocker data generator.

## Features
* QExplore targets the exploration of dynamic web applications.
* It also uses mocker data generator for feeding the input fields during the exploration.
* It allows users to define directives to excess parts of the web application restricted by specific user inputs.
* It allows users to define multiple user inputs for single input field. 
* QExplore automatically reverse engineer's a state-flow graph that can be used for testing activities such as test case generation and execution.
